Binary Search: starting in ascending order, set left and right indexes, find midpoint, take value at midpoint and compare it to the target.
				if target is less than the midpoint we know it has to occur earlier in the list, move R index over so it does not compare
				to every value. Move R to midpoint - 1. If target greater than midpoint, move L to midpoint + 1.
