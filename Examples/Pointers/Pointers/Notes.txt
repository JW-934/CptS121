Passing variables in normally copies them in, while pointers direct the function to the actual place in memory.

int result = divide(); copies the return value over but pointers circumvent this, no return statement needed.

Having multiple output values cannot be done with return statements, pointers required.

void* is a generic pointer, technically can be used with any type of pointer. (Not covered in this course)

The contents of a pointer is an address.

ptr_die1 copies the value of the pointer (NULL rn)

Debugger very useful, use the watch tab for pointers and ambiguous variables
